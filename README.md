# FS22 Australian License Plates
Australian Number Plates for Farming Simulator 22 Map Makers to use in their custom maps


Feel free to use these in any custom map you make for FS22.
You don't need to credit me.

NOTE: Only ONE set of state plates can be in a map at once. you can't have multiple sets. or, at least, i've not been able to find a way.
Also, It doesn't seem like you can make a license plate mod as a standalone mod. they seem to only work INSIDE a map file.
