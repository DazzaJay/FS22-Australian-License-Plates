# FS22 Australian License Plates
Australian Number Plates for Farming Simulator 22 Map Makers to use in their custom maps


Feel free to use these in any custom map you make for FS22.
You don't need to credit me.

NOTE: Only ONE set of state plates can be in a map at once. you can't have multiple sets. or, at least, i've not been able to find a way.
Also, It doesn't seem like you can make a license plate mod as a standalone mod. they seem to only work INSIDE a map file.


# TODO:
- [ ] **1. IN PROGRESS: Take New Screenshots.**
- Textures have been adjusted since last set of screenshots. Take new screenshots.

# KNOWN ISSUES:
- If you apply a set of plates with less style variations than the map already had, you may find the style box is blank - This is a game issue, not an issue with the mod.
     To fix this, simply purchase a vehile with whatever plate you're given, then close and reopen the store, and all the plate styles will now be there and be functioning properly.

- NPC Traffic Plates only work if your map was originally based on MapUS. For example; If replacing plates on a map based on MapFR or MapAlpine, Player owned vehicle plates will be the Australian style, NPC Traffic will not.
     No known solution at this time.

- Directory Structure for AI Traffic Vehicle License Plates is a bit wonky. Read the instructions carefully below.


# Manual Install Instructions (Not Prefab):
- The instructions may differ depending on the directory layout of your map.

- 1. Extract the licensePlates folder into your custom world's maps folder. 
For example, Southern Cross Station would be: FS22_SouthernCrossStation.zip\maps
so you will end up with: FS22_SouthernCrossStation.zip\maps\licensePlates

NOTE: If your map files are not in a /maps/ subfolder, you will still need to put the licensePlates folder inside a /maps/ folder.

- 2. Edit your map.xml so that then license plates line points to the correct location:
Here is the one that works here:

```<licensePlates filename="maps/licensePlates/licensePlatesUS.xml"/>```

- 3. Edit your trafficSystem.xml so that the license plates line points to the correct location:
For example: 

```<trafficSystem licensePlates="maps/licensePlates/aiLicensePlatesUS.i3d">```

NOTE: If your trafficSystem.XML is in a different folder to your map.xml then you must put the AI Licence Plates in a subfolder of the folder your trafficSystem.XML is in.

For example: the Western Australia map does not have a maps folder, and the trafficsystem.xml file is in a different subfolder. 

So you would have to put the aiLicensePlatesUS.i3d & aiLicensePlatesUS.i3d.shapes files in the following directory:
FS22_WesternAustralia.zip\xml\maps\licensePlates

And the licensePlatesUS_diffuse.dds & licensePlatesUS_normal.dds files in the following directory:
FS22_WesternAustralia.zip\xml\maps\licensePlates\Textures

NOTE: If no traffic cars spawn, your files are in the incorrect directory and more experimentation will be needed to fix it.
