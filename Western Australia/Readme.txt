For Adding these plates to your custom map:

1. Extract the licensePlates folder into your custom world's maps folder. 
For example, Southern Cross Station would be: FS22_SouthernCrossStation\maps
so you will end up with: FS22_SouthernCrossStation\maps\licensePlates

2. Edit your map.xml so that then license plates line points to the correct location:
Here is the one that works here:

<licensePlates filename="maps/licensePlates/licensePlatesUS.xml"/>
